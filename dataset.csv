It takes more courage to examine the dark corners of your own soul than it does for a soldier to fight on the battlefield.,success
"It takes only one person to make you happy and change your life: YOU

#selflove #MondayMotivation",happiness
"It takes someone special to love a person who is broken; someone willing to look past cracks &amp; fault lines to see the person. It takes someone with patience &amp; gentle spirit, who realizes that broken people may appear sharp &amp; hostile but are fragile &amp; need to be treated with care.",happiness
It took me long to understand what it's to forgive. I wondered how I could forgive someone who chose to hurt me. After a lot of soul searching I realized that forgiveness isn't accepting or excusing their behavior. It's about letting it go &amp; preventing it from destroying my heart,happiness
"It wasn’t the trauma that made you stronger, kinder and more empathetic. It’s how you handled it. The credit is yours.

It's a human phenomenon that there has to be a reason for everything. There almost never is. -- Theo Epstein,spiritual
"It's all about finding an honest person. A pure, selfless one. The one who looks at your heart and admires what it has been through, understands why it is the way it is and loves it anyway.

"It's all in the mindset. Your mindset determines how to see things, how you act, and ultimately, how you end up.",success
"It's amazing, the clarity &amp; peace of mind that comes from not caring about what anyone else is doing &amp; instead focusing all efforts on being you. Energy spent on worrying, feeling nothing at all, instantly fades away replaced by beautiful feeling that there isn't anyone like you.",happiness
"It's an honour to have you in life, as friend, partner, loved one. If they don't value your presence, they don't deserve being around you. There's nothing wrong with you. You are just at a wrong place. Allow yourself to move to a place where you aren't just valued, but treasured.",happiness
It's beautiful to be alone. To be alone does not mean to be lonely. It means the mind is not influenced and contaminated by society.,happiness
It's during the worst times of your life that you'll get to see the true colors of the people who say they care about you.,success
"It's during toughest times that you'll see true colors of those who say they care for you. Notice who sticks around &amp; who doesn't &amp; be grateful to those who leave; for they give you room to grow in space they abandoned, &amp; to appreciate those who loved you when you weren't lovable",happiness
"It's easy to judge other people's work when you're not the one doing it. What's hard is actually doing the work, and doing a good job.",success
"It's easy to judge.
It's more difficult to understand.
Understanding requires compassion, patience and a willingness to believe that good hearts sometimes choose poor methods.
Through judging, we separate.
Through understanding, we grow.

#SaturdayMotivation #compassion",happiness
"It's easy to look at people &amp; judge them, their present &amp; past. But you'd be amazed at the pain &amp; tears a single smile hides. What someone shows is only a tiny facet of iceberg hidden from sight. It's lined with cracks and scars at core. Respect &amp; acknowledge feelings of others.",happiness
"It's easy to lower standards &amp; be stuck in what others decide for you. It takes courage to face own demons &amp; do something meaningful. Discontentment is easier than creating a balance in life. But in the end, being happy is more important than being perfect as per others' vision.",happiness
It's enough to indulge and to be selfish but true happiness is really when you start giving back.,success
"It's funny how we outgrow what we once thought we couldn't live without and then fall in love with what we didn't even know we wanted.
Life leads us on journeys we would never go on if it were up to us.
Don't be afraid.
Find the lessons
Trust the journey

#happyLife #MondayVibes",happiness
It's good to forgive than stay resentful. But it's also important to understand where to draw boundaries &amp; how not to let anyone betray or hurt you the same way again. Let go of all that hurt you but take it as a lesson. Learn to value and respect the awesome person that you are.,happiness
"It's good to take break &amp; tune in to what brings a smile on your face. Instead of being critical of self, the way others are, give yourself unconditional love. Show yourself much deserved compassion. Forgive yourself. Celebrate life &amp; be the sunshine that spreads joy all around.",happiness
It's important that you focus on your well being. Worrying about tomorrow won't make it better. It will only steal your today from you. It is difficult but essential to stop obsessing about how things will be. Shift your focus from controlling and try to make your peace a focus.,happiness
"It's important to declutter your mind occasionally from criticism you hear from others or everything you are unable to forgive yourself for. If you allow to much negativity to take space in your thoughts, you block the flow of positive vibes. Give yourself a chance to be hopeful.",happiness
"It's important to have dreams. It gives you something to look forward to, to work up on &amp; something worth pursuing. But in that chase don't forget to ensure that what you're following is based on reality, not a fantasy. Make sure it's a vision, not an illusion that you're chasing",happiness
It's important to release yourself from the emotional games others play and to protect your inner peace. Guard yourself from anything that wastes your energy. Walk away from negativity and pay attention to the path you are destined to take on order to give yourself a joyous life.,happiness
"It's important to work hard &amp; keep pushing yourself but it's equally important to understand motivation behind the effort you're putting. If your intention is to prove to others that you aren't deficient, that implies people pleasing. Make sure what you do  brings you contentment",happiness
"It's natural to feel angry when someone or something hurts you, but eventually you have to let it go, before it destroys your peace of mind and your health.",success
It's never too late to change your life for the better. You don't have to take huge steps to change your life. Making even the smallest changes to your daily routine can make a big difference to your life.,success
"It's never too late. Never too late to start over, never too late to be happy.",success
It's not a question of learning much. On the contrary. It's a question of UNLEARNING much.,spiritual
"It's not about being the best, it's about being better than you were yesterday.",success
"It's not about having the skill to do something. It's about having the will, desire and commitment to be your best.",success
It's not about winning or losing. Sometimes we put so much stress on winning or losing that we don't recognize the lesson in everything. Lesson is what matters. It's how you'll win after loss. It's how you'll keep winning after you've won before. We must fail in order to succeed.,happiness
It's not good to challenge things you can't control. Let them be. Know that going with the flow is important at times. You don't have to give up but don't be distressed either. Give it some time. Stay on sidelines if you aren't sure of what to do. With times you will get clarity.,happiness
It's not really letting go of the past that is the problem. It's coming to terms with letting go of a possible future that won't ever be. The mind wants to keep its fantasies even when they are unhealthy &amp; cruel. To let go of past you must let go of future &amp; live in the present.,happiness
It's not what we do once in a while that shapes our lives. It's what we do consistently.,success
"It's not wrong to prioritize yourself. It's not selfish. Others' reactions are their insecurities &amp; have nothing to do with how you should be. You matter. You're important. Show yourself some compassion. The way you sacrifice yourself for others, they need to do the same for you.",happiness
It's not your responsibility to change course of someone else's struggle. Help when &amp; where you can without giving away so much of yourself that you begin to struggle too. Give love &amp; support. Hold space. Be fully present with ones u love. But never give too much of yourself away,happiness
"It's ok if you fall down and lose your spark.
Just make sure that when you get back up, you rise as the blaze.

#strength #Mindset #TuesdayMorning",happiness
"It's ok to want your own happiness, to care about yourself the most. You aren't obligated to sit there &amp; smile &amp; swallow everything others heap on you. You've right to protest your mistreatment &amp; set boundaries. The world doesn't realize you have this right but it is yours.
#life",happiness
It's okay if others don't have genuine intentions &amp; pure soul like you. It's okay if everything turned out to be more of an illusion rather than something real. Let the experiences in life help you make wiser future choices. You're kind &amp; your compassion is what you need the most,happiness
"It's okay if the choices you make today are different from what you believed to be your journey earlier. You learn, you grow. It's okay to have different perspective. It's okay to change priority. Don't stop your growth with too many questions. If it feels right today, go for it.",happiness
"It's okay if you thought you were over it but it hits you all over again. It's okay to fall apart even after you thought you had it under control. You are not weak. Healing is messy. And there is no timeline for healing.

It's okay to be angry. It's never okay to be cruel.,success
It's okay to feel low. It's okay to feel lonely. It's okay to cry even if it makes no sense. It's okay to feel upset for no reason. It's okay to give more than you should. Allow yourself to be imperfect. Life won't always support you. But you need to be the kind support you need.,happiness
"It's okay to not have all the answers yet.
It's okay to not have it all together yet.
Sometimes it's over the course of the journey that you learn about destination.
You will figure it out.
Trust the process and take a leap of faith.

#positivemindset #SundayMotivation",happiness
It's okay to not have everything figured out. Allow confusions that seem to be out of your control. Embrace chaos of journey &amp; go with the flow. Life may eventually take you to magical places you dreamt of but never imagined you can reach. Make room for miracles waiting for you.,happiness
It's okay to want own happiness. It's okay to care about self the most. You have right to protest mistreatment and set boundaries for respectful interactions. World doesn't realize you have this right and will often be offended and appalled when you exercise it. But it is yours.,happiness
It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything.,success
It's really not about what you have. It's about how you're able to enjoy life in general.,success
"It's the small habits

How you spend your mornings
How you talk to yourself
What you read and what you watch
Who you share your energy with
Who has access to you

That will change your life

#tuesdayvibe #tuesdaymotivations",happiness
It's time to reclaim your power. It's time to realize that your happiness is in your control &amp; not dependent on any person or thing. Look past the complaints you have and lack you feel. You are enough. All you need is to elevate quality of thoughts. Create your joy &amp; be grateful.,happiness
It's up to you to find beauty in the ugliest of days.,success
It's very difficult to make a 100% turnaround. It's tough when you actually do exhibit patterns of bad behavior. You need to have a very strong support system of people who are willing to keep you in your place if you're going to overcome these things.,success
"It's very rare to find someone who genuinely cares for you, someone who wants to see you achieve your dreams, encourages you to grow and is always there through all your messes; someone without any other agenda. Be grateful for all those people and always keep them close.",happiness
"It's vital that you accept yourself and learn to be happy with who God made you to be. If you want to truly enjoy your life, you must be at peace with yourself.",success
"It's you blocking your blessings, not the destiny. There are doorways in front of you that you ignore because they're too good to be true. You let fears rule you. Be open to the experiences life is trying to show you, even if they are nothing like the life you are taught to lead.",happiness
It's your mind that determines the quality of your life more than anything else.,success
"Its good to leave each day behind,
Like flowing water, free of sadness.
Yesterday is gone and its tale told.
Today new seeds are growing.",success
"Its okay if you fell for wrong people. Its okay if you chased things not meant for you. Its okay to feel miserable for losses. But its not okay to dwell in misery &amp; curse yourself for the loss. We all make mistakes. Learn from it, rise &amp; decide to make better choices. That's it.",happiness
